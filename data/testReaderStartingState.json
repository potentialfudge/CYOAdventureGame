You look for it to see what it is, and it's a clay tablet that looks like it's from at least 2000 years ago. On it, there's something written in a strange language you don't understand, but a few drawings at the bottom resemble a treasure chest of gold, and some other creatures you've never heard of before. There might be a lost treasure, you think.",

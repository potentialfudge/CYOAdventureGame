# My Personal Project

## A choose-your-own-adventure game with word puzzles along the way

My application will:
- Let users play an adventure game where they can choose how they want the story to go.
- Have users be presented with two options at each part of the storyline, where they will choose one of the two.
- Present users with a word-guessing puzzle (inspired by *Wordle*) at certain points in the story, where they can only proceed further upon successful completion of the puzzle. After 6 unsuccessful guesses, they lose all their progress and return to the first stage of the game.

Who can use it? \
Anyone who has an interest in adventure games and fun word puzzles!

Why is this project of interest to *me*? \
I personally am one of those people really interested in both choose-your-own-adventure (CYOA) games and word puzzles like *Wordle*, and I haven't seen a game that combines both of those. Because of that, I thought it would be an interesting and challenging task to take on for the term project.

## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to:
- Choose one of the two options presented to me that determines what happens next, thus adding to the list of my choices made in the game.
- View the list of choices I've made at each stage so far.
- Play a word guessing puzzle at certain stages, adding variety to the game.
- Get feedback after each word puzzle guess, so I can understand which letters are correct and improve my guesses.
- Have different endings based on my choices and puzzle outcomes, so I can play the game multiple times to discover all possible endings.

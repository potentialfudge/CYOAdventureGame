# My Personal Project

## A choose-your-own-adventure game with word puzzles along the way

My application will:
- Let users play an adventure game where they can choose how they want the story to go.
- Have users be presented with two options at each part of the storyline, where they will choose one of the two.
- Present users with a word-guessing puzzle (inspired by *Wordle*) at certain points in the story, where they can only proceed further upon successful completion of the puzzle.

Who can use it? \
Anyone who has an interest in adventure games and fun word puzzles!

Why is this project of interest to *me*? \
I personally am one of those people really interested in both choose-your-own-adventure (CYOA) games and word puzzles like *Wordle*, and I haven't seen a game that combines both of those. Because of that, I thought it would be an interesting and challenging task to take on for the term project.
